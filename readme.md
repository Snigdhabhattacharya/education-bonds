The Educational Bonds Smart Contract facilitates the issuance and repayment of bonds specifically for educational institutions. By leveraging blockchain technology, it ensures transparency, security, and efficiency in managing financial obligations between educational institutions and bondholders. The contract is designed to enable educational institutions to issue bonds for funding, which are then repaid with interest upon maturity.

## Flowchart

1. **Authorization of Institutions**
   - **Owner** authorizes or deauthorizes institutions.

2. **Bond Issuance**
   - **Owner** issues a bond to an authorized institution.
   - Bond details include amount, maturity date, and interest rate.

3. **Bond Repayment**
   - **Institution** repays the bond with interest.
   - **Owner** receives the repayment.

4. **Withdrawal**
   - **Owner** can withdraw any accidentally sent Ether.

   ```plaintext
   [Authorize Institution] -> [Issue Bond] -> [Repay Bond] -> [Transfer Funds]

                      \                                /
                       [Withdraw Funds from Contract]
   ```
